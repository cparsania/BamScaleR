# Benchmarking BamScaleR: reader throughput and end-to-end workflow impact

## Overview

`BamScaleR` is a multithreaded BAM reader, built on the `ompBAM` OpenMP
engine, that returns the same native Bioconductor objects as the
standard readers and is a drop-in replacement for
[`Rsamtools::scanBam`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/Rsamtools/man/scanBam.html)
and
[`GenomicAlignments::readGAlignments`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/GenomicAlignments/man/readGAlignments.html).

Reading a BAM is only one step of an analysis, so a faster reader speeds
a workflow end-to-end **only in proportion to the time that workflow
spends reading** (Amdahl’s law). This vignette summarises benchmarks
that quantify *both* the raw read speedup and its end-to-end effect on
two standard workflows — coverage/bigWig track generation and ATAC-seq
fragment-size QC — with BamScaleR output verified **byte-identical** to
the standard tools.

The numbers below are a concise summary of a representative benchmark
run (Intel Xeon Gold 6252, 96 cores; warm page cache; median of 5
iterations). The benchmark harness that produces them is in
`inst/benchmarks/` (`run_server_benchmark.R`,
`run_workflow_benchmark.R`); see the last section to reproduce the full
results.

## Read throughput on a single large BAM

On a single large BAM, BamScaleR reads **2.5–4x faster** than the
standard reader across three representative access patterns, because it
spreads the BGZF decode across cores and assembles the output objects in
native code:

| Workload | Reads | Standard (s) | BamScaleR (s) | Threads | Speedup |
|:---|:---|---:|---:|---:|:---|
| Core fields | qname/flag/rname/pos/mapq/cigar | 15.4 | 6.3 | 48 | 2.45x |
| GAlignments | -\> GAlignments object | 10.6 | 2.6 | 48 | 4.03x |
| Sequence + quality | seq + base quality | 21.6 | 7.0 | 48 | 3.09x |

Single-file read throughput: best BamScaleR configuration vs the
single-threaded standard reader (median of 5 iterations). {.table}

Two honest points. At **one thread** BamScaleR is modestly faster than
the single-threaded readers (about 1.1–1.3x, from native-code object
assembly); most of the win comes from threading, and the scaling is
**strongly sublinear** – roughly 2.5–4x on 48 threads, largely
saturating between 24 and 48 threads. The value is not near-linear
scaling but the ability to use cores that a single-threaded reader
cannot use at all – as on one large BAM in an interactive session.
Object-free command-line decoders such as `samtools` reach several-fold
higher *raw* throughput, but return no Bioconductor object; BamScaleR’s
role is fast, object-faithful decoding *inside* R.

## End-to-end impact tracks the read fraction

Embedding BamScaleR as the read step of a complete workflow, the
end-to-end speedup follows how read-dominated that workflow is (Amdahl’s
law):

| Endpoint                  | Layer    | Read fraction | Speedup |
|:--------------------------|:---------|:--------------|:--------|
| ATAC fragment-size QC     | workflow | 92%           | 4.14x   |
| GAlignments (read)        | read     | 100%          | 4.03x   |
| Coverage -\> RleList      | workflow | 76%           | 3.29x   |
| Sequence + quality (read) | read     | 100%          | 3.09x   |
| Core fields (read)        | read     | 100%          | 2.45x   |
| Coverage -\> bigWig       | workflow | 22%           | 1.24x   |

End-to-end speedup by workload endpoint. Read-pattern rows are
single-file read throughput; workflow rows are end-to-end. Read fraction
is the share of the standard pipeline spent reading. {.table}

![](benchmark-results_files/figure-html/spectrum-plot-1.png)

- **ATAC fragment-size QC** is nearly pure read, so BamScaleR’s read
  speedup carries through almost intact: **4.14x** end-to-end.
- **Coverage -\> bigWig** is dominated by the shared, single-threaded
  [`rtracklayer::export.bw`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/rtracklayer/man/BigWigFile.html)
  step (identical work on both arms), so the end-to-end gain is bounded
  at **1.24x** even though the read phase itself is 6.6x faster.
  Stopping at the in-memory coverage `RleList` – what many analyses
  consume next – recovers a **3.29x** gain.
  ([`bam_coverage()`](https://cparsania.github.io/BamScaleR/reference/bam_coverage.md)
  and
  [`bam_coverage_bigwig()`](https://cparsania.github.io/BamScaleR/reference/bam_coverage_bigwig.md)
  compute these endpoints directly inside the reader, removing the
  R-side read phase entirely; see the function documentation.)

## A note on cores and fairness

A multithreaded reader can occupy cores a single-threaded one cannot. At
**matched core counts** (both arms given the same number of cores) the
two readers are approximately at parity for multi-file processing
(coverage ~1.13x, ATAC ~0.99x): the single-threaded reader already
saturates a machine by parallelising *across* files, so BamScaleR’s
multi-file advantage comes specifically from also threading *within* a
file – which pays off when there are fewer files than cores.

## Beyond reading: in-reader aggregation

For workflows whose endpoint is a summary rather than the alignments
themselves, BamScaleR provides four functions that fold the computation
inside the multithreaded reader, so no per-read R objects are ever
materialised:
[`fragment_sizes()`](https://cparsania.github.io/BamScaleR/reference/fragment_sizes.md)
(paired-end fragment-size distribution),
[`mapq_dist()`](https://cparsania.github.io/BamScaleR/reference/mapq_dist.md)
(mapping-quality distribution),
[`bam_coverage()`](https://cparsania.github.io/BamScaleR/reference/bam_coverage.md)
(per-base coverage `RleList`), and
[`bam_coverage_bigwig()`](https://cparsania.github.io/BamScaleR/reference/bam_coverage_bigwig.md)
(single-pass BAM to bigWig with parallel block compression). Each is
verified byte-identical to its standard equivalent
(`table(abs(scanBam(isize)))`, `table(scanBam(mapq))`,
`coverage(readGAlignments())`, and the serial bigWig writer
respectively) – see their reference pages. These remove the read phase
from the Amdahl decomposition above entirely; comprehensive benchmarks
on public ENCODE data accompany the manuscript.

## Output is identical to the standard tools

Every speedup above is against output verified equal to the standard
tool. The coverage `RleList` is
[`identical()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/identical.html) to
[`GenomicAlignments::coverage()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/IRanges/man/coverage-methods.html)
on `readGAlignments` output at every thread count, and the ATAC
fragment-size table is
[`identical()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/identical.html) to
[`Rsamtools::scanBam`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/Rsamtools/man/scanBam.html)
and byte-identical (maximum absolute difference 0) to
`ATACseqQC::fragSizeDist` over 49.8 million reads. This is what makes
BamScaleR a genuine drop-in rather than an approximation.

## Try it

## Reproducing the full benchmarks

The complete benchmark harness ships under `inst/benchmarks/`:

``` r

dir(system.file("benchmarks", package = "BamScaleR"))
# run_server_benchmark.R      : read-pattern micro-benchmarks (step1 / GAlignments / seq+qual)
# run_workflow_benchmark.R    : end-to-end coverage and ATAC fragment-size QC workflows
# download_atac_data.R        : fetch + index the ENCODE GM12878 ATAC BAMs used here
```

Each writes machine-readable result tables (`summary.csv`) plus host and
correctness metadata, from which the summary figures above are derived.
